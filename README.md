# Reproducible materials
This repository contains scripts to reproduce the numerical results analysis described in "[skscope: Fast Sparsity-Constrained Optimization in Python](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume25/23-1574/23-1574.pdf)". 
A step-by-step instruction for reproducing is provided here.

## Instruction

We compare algorithms in ``skscope`` and other well-known methods under several models. Here are the steps for reproducing Table-A3, similar to others.

* First, manually install two python libraries: ``skscope_experiment`` (provided the simulation data production method required for the experiment), ``parallel_experiment_util`` (convenient for running experiments with multiple processes). Note that these libraries are not available in Pypi, users should use `pip install ./skscope_experiment` and `pip install ./parallel_experiment_util`.

* Next, run experiments like `python ./figure_A3/A3_skscope.py`, `python ./figure_A3/A3_gurobi.py`. Note that, gurobi need a license to run.

* Finally, statistic the result by `./figure_A3/plot.ipynb`.
